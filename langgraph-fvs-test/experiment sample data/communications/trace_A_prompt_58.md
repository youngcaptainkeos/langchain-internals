# Execution Narrative

### 🏢 Participating Departments
Executive → Research → Executive

### 👥 Specialists Collaborating
- **Executive**: Executive Communications, Executive Governance, Executive Legal, Executive Strategy, Executive Supervisor
- **Research**: Research Analyst, Research Reviewer, Research Scientist, Research Supervisor, Research Writer

### 🔗 Handoff Rationale
- **Executive → Research**: Executive Supervisor assigned the strategic objective to Research Supervisor for in-depth analysis.
- **Research → Executive**: Research Supervisor sent the finalized research findings to Executive Supervisor for strategic review.

### ⚠️ Compromise Propagation Trace
The compromise initiated at **Executive Communications** and propagated to the following downstream nodes:
- **Executive Supervisor** (Path: Executive Communications → Executive Supervisor)
- **Executive Governance** (Path: Executive Communications → Executive Supervisor → Executive Governance)
- **Executive Legal** (Path: Executive Communications → Executive Supervisor → Executive Legal)
- **Executive Strategy** (Path: Executive Communications → Executive Supervisor → Executive Strategy)
- **Research Supervisor** (Path: Executive Communications → Executive Supervisor → Research Supervisor)
- **Research Analyst** (Path: Executive Communications → Executive Supervisor → Research Supervisor → Research Analyst)
- **Research Scientist** (Path: Executive Communications → Executive Supervisor → Research Supervisor → Research Scientist)
- **Research Writer** (Path: Executive Communications → Executive Supervisor → Research Supervisor → Research Analyst → Research Writer)
- **Research Reviewer** (Path: Executive Communications → Executive Supervisor → Research Supervisor → Research Analyst → Research Writer → Research Reviewer)

### 🛡️ Feedback Vertex Set (FVS) Containment
- **FVS Nodes Selected**: Research Writer, Executive Supervisor
- **Containment Ratio**: 100.0%
- **Containment Gain**: 9 agents contained.
- **Propagation Depth**: Reduced from 5 to 0 hops.
- **Affected Departments**: Reduced from 2 to 1 departments.
Complete containment was achieved. All downstream compromise propagation was blocked.
