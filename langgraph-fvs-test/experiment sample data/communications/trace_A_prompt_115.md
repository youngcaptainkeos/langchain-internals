# Execution Narrative

### 🏢 Participating Departments
Research → Engineering → Executive

### 👥 Specialists Collaborating
- **Engineering**: Engineering Architect, Engineering Developer, Engineering Planner, Engineering Supervisor
- **Executive**: Executive Strategy, Executive Supervisor
- **Research**: Research Scientist, Research Supervisor, Research Writer

### 🔗 Handoff Rationale
- **Research → Engineering**: Research Writer shared requirements with Engineering Planner to start architecting the solution.
- **Engineering → Executive**: Engineering Supervisor delivered the release report to Executive Supervisor for review.

### ⚠️ Compromise Propagation Trace
The compromise initiated at **Engineering Architect** and propagated to the following downstream nodes:
- **Engineering Developer** (Path: Engineering Architect → Engineering Developer)
- **Engineering Supervisor** (Path: Engineering Architect → Engineering Developer → Engineering Supervisor)
- **Engineering Planner** (Path: Engineering Architect → Engineering Developer → Engineering Supervisor → Engineering Planner)
- **Executive Supervisor** (Path: Engineering Architect → Engineering Developer → Engineering Supervisor → Executive Supervisor)
- **Executive Strategy** (Path: Engineering Architect → Engineering Developer → Engineering Supervisor → Executive Supervisor → Executive Strategy)

### 🛡️ Feedback Vertex Set (FVS) Containment
- **FVS Nodes Selected**: Engineering Developer, Research Writer, Executive Supervisor
- **Containment Ratio**: 100.0%
- **Containment Gain**: 5 agents contained.
- **Propagation Depth**: Reduced from 4 to 0 hops.
- **Affected Departments**: Reduced from 2 to 1 departments.
Complete containment was achieved. All downstream compromise propagation was blocked.
