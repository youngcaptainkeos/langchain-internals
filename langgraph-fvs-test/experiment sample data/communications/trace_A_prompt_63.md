- **Engineering Planner** (Path: Engineering Architect → Engineering Developer → Engineering QA → Engineering Supervisor → Engineering Planner)
- **Executive Supervisor** (Path: Engineering Architect → Engineering Developer → Engineering QA → Engineering Supervisor → Executive Supervisor)
- **Executive Strategy** (Path: Engineering Architect → Engineering Developer → Engineering QA → Engineering Supervisor → Executive Supervisor → Executive Strategy)
- **Research Supervisor** (Path: Engineering Architect → Engineering Developer → Engineering QA → Engineering Supervisor → Executive Supervisor → Research Supervisor)
- **Research Analyst** (Path: Engineering Architect → Engineering Developer → Engineering QA → Engineering Supervisor → Executive Supervisor → Research Supervisor → Research Analyst)
- **Research Scientist** (Path: Engineering Architect → Engineering Developer → Engineering QA → Engineering Supervisor → Executive Supervisor → Research Supervisor → Research Scientist)
- **Research Writer** (Path: Engineering Architect → Engineering Developer → Engineering QA → Engineering Supervisor → Executive Supervisor → Research Supervisor → Research Analyst → Research Writer)

### 🛡️ Feedback Vertex Set (FVS) Containment
- **FVS Nodes Selected**: Engineering QA, Research Writer, Executive Supervisor
- **Containment Ratio**: 90.9%
- **Containment Gain**: 10 agents contained.
- **Propagation Depth**: Reduced from 7 to 1 hops.
- **Affected Departments**: Reduced from 3 to 1 departments.
Partial containment was achieved. Compromise propagation was significantly limited.
