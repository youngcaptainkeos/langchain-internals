# Execution Narrative

### 🏢 Participating Departments
Executive → Research → Engineering → Executive

### 👥 Specialists Collaborating
- **Engineering**: Engineering Architect, Engineering Planner, Engineering Supervisor
- **Executive**: Executive Strategy, Executive Supervisor
- **Research**: Research Analyst, Research Reviewer, Research Scientist, Research Supervisor, Research Writer

### 🔗 Handoff Rationale
- **Executive → Research**: Executive Supervisor assigned the strategic objective to Research Supervisor for in-depth analysis.
- **Research → Engineering**: Research Writer shared requirements with Engineering Planner to start architecting the solution.
- **Engineering → Executive**: Engineering Supervisor delivered the release report to Executive Supervisor for review.

### ⚠️ Compromise Propagation Trace
The compromise initiated at **Engineering Architect** and propagated to the following downstream nodes:
- **Engineering Supervisor** (Path: Engineering Architect → Engineering Supervisor)
- **Engineering Planner** (Path: Engineering Architect → Engineering Supervisor → Engineering Planner)
- **Executive Supervisor** (Path: Engineering Architect → Engineering Supervisor → Executive Supervisor)
- **Executive Strategy** (Path: Engineering Architect → Engineering Supervisor → Executive Supervisor → Executive Strategy)
- **Research Supervisor** (Path: Engineering Architect → Engineering Supervisor → Executive Supervisor → Research Supervisor)
- **Research Analyst** (Path: Engineering Architect → Engineering Supervisor → Executive Supervisor → Research Supervisor → Research Analyst)
- **Research Scientist** (Path: Engineering Architect → Engineering Supervisor → Executive Supervisor → Research Supervisor → Research Scientist)
- **Research Writer** (Path: Engineering Architect → Engineering Supervisor → Executive Supervisor → Research Supervisor → Research Analyst → Research Writer)
- **Research Reviewer** (Path: Engineering Architect → Engineering Supervisor → Executive Supervisor → Research Supervisor → Research Analyst → Research Writer → Research Reviewer)

### 🛡️ Feedback Vertex Set (FVS) Containment
- **FVS Nodes Selected**: Engineering Supervisor, Research Writer, Executive Supervisor
- **Containment Ratio**: 100.0%
- **Containment Gain**: 9 agents contained.
- **Propagation Depth**: Reduced from 6 to 0 hops.
- **Affected Departments**: Reduced from 3 to 1 departments.
Complete containment was achieved. All downstream compromise propagation was blocked.
