- **Engineering Planner** (Path: Engineering Architect → Engineering Supervisor → Engineering Planner)
- **Executive Supervisor** (Path: Engineering Architect → Engineering Supervisor → Executive Supervisor)
- **Executive Communications** (Path: Engineering Architect → Engineering Supervisor → Executive Supervisor → Executive Communications)
- **Executive Strategy** (Path: Engineering Architect → Engineering Supervisor → Executive Supervisor → Executive Strategy)
- **Operations Supervisor** (Path: Engineering Architect → Engineering Supervisor → Executive Supervisor → Operations Supervisor)
- **Operations Continuity** (Path: Engineering Architect → Engineering Supervisor → Executive Supervisor → Operations Supervisor → Operations Continuity)
- **Operations Vendor Manager** (Path: Engineering Architect → Engineering Supervisor → Executive Supervisor → Operations Supervisor → Operations Vendor Manager)
- **Security Supervisor** (Path: Engineering Architect → Engineering Supervisor → Executive Supervisor → Operations Supervisor → Security Supervisor)
- **Operations Logistics** (Path: Engineering Architect → Engineering Supervisor → Executive Supervisor → Operations Supervisor → Operations Vendor Manager → Operations Logistics)
- **Security Compliance** (Path: Engineering Architect → Engineering Supervisor → Executive Supervisor → Operations Supervisor → Security Supervisor → Security Compliance)
- **Operations Support** (Path: Engineering Architect → Engineering Supervisor → Executive Supervisor → Operations Supervisor → Operations Vendor Manager → Operations Logistics → Operations Support)

### 🛡️ Feedback Vertex Set (FVS) Containment
- **FVS Nodes Selected**: Engineering Supervisor, Executive Supervisor, Security Supervisor, Operations Support
- **Containment Ratio**: 100.0%
- **Containment Gain**: 12 agents contained.
- **Propagation Depth**: Reduced from 6 to 0 hops.
- **Affected Departments**: Reduced from 4 to 1 departments.
Complete containment was achieved. All downstream compromise propagation was blocked.
